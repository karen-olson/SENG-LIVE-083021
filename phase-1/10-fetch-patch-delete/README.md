# Fetch with PATCH and DELETE

json-server --watch db.json

### SWBAT:

- Execute patch requests
- Execute delete requests

#### Warm up

Go over solution for Friday's exercise. This is a good time to review everything with the students

### Exercise Deliverables:

- For this exercise, we will create an interface that allows users to comment on the collection of cards.
- We have an endpoint `http://localhost:3000/comments` that will host the collection of comments submitted by a user. We will use this endpoint for any requests made in respect to comments.
- Currently we do not have the following:

  1. A form to submit a comment
  2. A request made to the server after the form has been submitted.
  3. Do not worry about displaying the comments currently. For now you can console.log the response to the request and inspect the data that is received.

- BONUS: If you have completed the above exercise, try to display the comments on the page. Do not worry about styling. You can be creative and display the comments as you would like. Things to think about:
  1. How to retreive all comments?
  2. Where should the comments exist?
  3. How to display comments?

### Segment 1:

Review code, review events and functions that pertain to the like button.

The first deliverable is to send a PATCH request to server in order to make an update to the likes when it is clicked.

- Go over routing, and discuss how the goal is to change one pokemon.
- ID's are really important because we can use it to make any modifications to a single resource.

create a function to updateLikes that will receive the pokemon as an argument

```
function updateLikes(pokemon){
  debugger;
}
```

I placed a debugger for a few reasons:

1. Make sure this get's invoked on a click
2. Check the value of the parameter 'pokemon'
3. Test the endpoint

```
http://localhost:3000/pokemons/${pokemon.id}
```

We can make our fetch request to this endpoint because it is dealing with 1 resource which is the pokemon that was clicked.

```
function updateLikes(pokemon) {
  fetch(`http://localhost:3000/pokemons/${pokemon.id}`, {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ likes: pokemon.likes }),
  });
}
```

### Send a DELETE request and update the DOM

```
  fetch(`http://localhost:3000/pokemons/${pokemon.id}`, {
    method: "DELETE",
  });
```

This will cause an error, point the error out and ask students to help debug the issue

Need to add pokemon upon event

add a debugger and verify that values are as anticipated

```
function deletePoke(pokemon, pokeCard) {
  debugger;
  fetch(`http://localhost:3000/pokemons/${pokemon.id}`, {
    method: "DELETE",
  });

  pokeCard.remove();
}
```
